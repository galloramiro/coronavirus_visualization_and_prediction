# Coronavirus Visualization and Prediction 
This repository tracks the spread of the novel coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a contagious respiratory virus that first started in Wuhan in December 2019. On 2/11/2020, the disease is officially named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization.

Due to the large file size, I am unable to upload the latest kernel to Github. You can access my last updated work here:
